# 🔗 URL Shortener (Learning Project)

This is a simple URL shortener built using **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.

I followed a tutorial for the core logic, but extended it by:

* Adding `.env` for secure MongoDB connection
* Setting up proper `.gitignore`
* Pushing the project cleanly to GitHub
* Managing Git from local machine

This project was mainly an experiment to understand:

* Express routing
* Mongoose models
* MongoDB collections
* Environment variables
* Git & GitHub workflow

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* EJS

## ⚙️ Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhushanbaskar/url_shortner.git
cd url_shortner
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=1000
```

Start server:

```bash
npm start
```

## 🚀 What I Learned

* How short URLs are stored and redirected
* How Mongoose auto-creates collections
* Why `.env` is important
* How to push a backend project safely to GitHub
